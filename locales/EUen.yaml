  Journey2Description: Hey, gang! I've decided that my next stop on the Wandercrust
    Tour will be Greater Inkopolis. <br />I actually grew up in the area, but I haven't
    been back in a hot minute. <br />So this journey will be all about self-discovery.
    I want to examine my soggy past and work on making my future as crispy as possible.<br
    />After all, if you're not double frying, you're not trying. Right?!
  Journey2Gratitude: Wow! Thanks to you, I was able to do a deep-fry dive on my past
    and come out crispy on the other side.<br />I sent a little something to your
    lobby terminal as a token of my appreciation. Thank you again!
  Journey2Title: The Journey Continues<br />I pedal faster not because I have more
    legs but because of my gear ratio.

  Story1: How's it fryin', folks? Crusty Sean coming at ya. I'm going on the trip
    of a lifetime, and I'm a little light on funds. That's where you come in!
  Story2: It turns out it takes more than a bike and a heart full of hype to see the
    world, but I'm fried up to see what's out there, and I'm hoping you are too. So
    let's help each other out. Help me on my crusty quest, and I'll show you all the
    cool things I find. Yep—I'll do all the hard work. You just kick back (and, y'know,
    cheer)!
  Story3: Just imagine it—all the sweetest scenes and most savory moments the world
    has to offer...and I'll be sharing every little crumb with my supporters! It'll
    be just like you're out there with me. Kinda. Alright, time to hop out of the
    fryer and onto my bike. The air's crisp, the road's crunchy, and I am outta here.
    Wish me luck! And then send me lots of points!
